"""PlannerAgent.

Coordinates deterministic planning steps from events:
- Replays the latest scan to collect candidate files
- Applies rules to emit ``RuleMatched`` events
- Optionally computes simple embeddings and clusters to emit ``ClustersFormed``
- Materializes the current plan and emits ``PlanProposed`` with item ids

The agent is offline by default and avoids any network calls.
